# hello-world

Hi Everyone! Thank you for comming!

I'm an ordinary and boring person who doesn't know English (I write this text through the Google-Translator) and didn't write the code. But I really want to change my life and myself. I hope that I will succeed and I will not give up programming as I gave up many different activities in my life.

Not saying goodbye!
